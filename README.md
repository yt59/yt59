# Hi there ^_^

This is Younes Torshizi!

I'm a software developer. I want to be a better person therefore I share my thoughts and opinions to reveal it's bugs in order to debug them.

My regards to friends who tolerate my behavior :))

BTW I'm an INTP-A according to www.16personalities.com.

## Classes

In my opinion, only thing I can control is my time. So I classify people to five class to specify my behavior. Here is the classes:

ID | Name | Brief | How to promote | How to demote
-- | ---- | ----- | ------- | ------
1 | Best Friends | Who have all of my time |  |  They want it
2 | Friends | Who just need to ask for it | Ask promotion | Prove of better using time is not valid anymore
3 | People | Who must pay for it | Prove that they using my time better than me | Waste my time
4 | Hated | Who must bring an intercessor | Have a shot for the sake of intercessor | Using my time to get me in trouble
5 | Enemies | Who can not have it | Have only one shot with intercession of a best friend |

> By default everyone is on 3 state.

> Anybody can ask state of any one.

## Specify my behavior

Enemies

> Even if I see them lying dead, I won't help them

Hated

> They are not worth it, but they can use credit of the ones with value. by saying they are not worthy of my time, I mean any time even talking time.
 it's a favor to them that I am answering them.

People

> Most of them are unknown people. I'm using Sheldon's gift giving theory on them, the gift of my time in exchange of anything they offer.

Friends

> Ones whom I adore and teach me how to live. They are the ones, wanting the best for me and I want the best for them. The cost of using my time for them is watching their happiness.

Best Friends

> The ones I'm ready to die for saving their life.

### Priorities

It's obvious that higher class persons have higher priorities. by that I mean if I receive a request from a higher priority than the person whom use my time, asap I cut it and dedicate my time to the one who is more important.

In the each class people have different priorities.
In general priorities specify by a killing like machine that as function it's getting two person as parameter and kill exact one person that has less value.
The value is a measure of the actual and potential movement of the person towards the utopia in my view and the surviver earns higher priority.
When I get a request when spending time to another person, I use the machine to calculate priority in order to determine how should I act.
