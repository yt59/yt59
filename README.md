# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Younes Torshizi!

I'm a software developer.I enjoy talking about abstractions. I want to be a better person therefore I share my thoughts and opinions to get tested and reveal the bugs. 

Thanks to friends who tolerate my behavior :))

BTW I'm an INTP-A according to www.16personalities.com.

## Classes
In my opinion my time is the only thing that I can contorl. So I classify people to five class to specify my behavior. Here is the classes:


ID | Name | Brief | Promote | Demote 
-- | ---- | ----- | ------- | ------
1 | Best Friends | Who have all of my time |  |  They want it
2 | Friends | Who just need ask for it | Ask promotion | Prove of better using time is not valid anymore
3 | People | Who must pay for it | Prove that they using my time better than me | Waste my time
4 | Hated | Who must bring an intercessor | Have a shot for sake of intercessor | Using my time to get me in trouble
5 | Enemy | Who can not have it | Have only one shot with intercession of a best friend | 

> By default everyone is on 3 state.

> Anybody can ask his/her state.

# Specify my behavior
