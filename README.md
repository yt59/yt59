# Hi there

This is Younes Torshizi!

I'm a software developer. I want to be a better person therefore I share my thoughts and opinions to reveal it's bugs and debuging. 

Thanks to friends who tolerate my behavior :))

BTW I'm an INTP-A according to www.16personalities.com.

## Classes
In my opinion my time is the only thing that I can contorl. So I classify people to five class to specify my behavior. Here is the classes:


ID | Name | Brief | How to promote | How to demote 
-- | ---- | ----- | ------- | ------
1 | Best Friends | Who have all of my time |  |  They want it
2 | Friends | Who just need to ask for it | Ask promotion | Prove of better using time is not valid anymore
3 | People | Who must pay for it | Prove that they using my time better than me | Waste my time
4 | Hated | Who must bring an intercessor | Have a shot for the sake of intercessor | Using my time to get me in trouble
5 | Enemies | Who can not have it | Have only one shot with intercession of a best friend | 

> By default everyone is on 3 state.

> Anybody can ask his/her state.


## Specify my behavior


Enemies

> If I even see them dropping dead,I won't help them.

Hated

> They not worth it, but they can use credit of the ones who worth it. by saying they not worth my time, I mean any time even talking time.
 it's a favor to them that I answer them.

People

> Most of them are unknown people. I'm using Sheldon's gift giving theory theory on them, the gift of my time in exchange of anything they offer.

Friends

> The ones who I love and teach me how to live. The ones who want the best for me and I want best for them.
The cost of using my time by them is watching their happiness.

Best Friends

> The ones I'm ready to die for saving their life.
